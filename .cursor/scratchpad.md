# Background and Motivation

The goal is to ensure the website is fully responsive across all device sizes: mobile, tablet, and desktop. This will improve user experience, accessibility, and engagement regardless of the device used. The project uses React, Vite, TypeScript, shadcn-ui, and Tailwind CSS, which provides a strong foundation for responsive design.

# Key Challenges and Analysis

- **Audit of Current Responsiveness:** Some components may already be partially responsive due to Tailwind defaults, but a thorough audit is needed.
- **Component Granularity:** Each page may have multiple components; all must be checked for layout, font, and interaction issues at different breakpoints.
- **shadcn-ui Integration:** Ensure that customizations or overrides to shadcn-ui components do not break responsiveness.
- **Testing:** Need to verify on real device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) and possibly use browser dev tools for simulation.
- **Performance:** Avoid unnecessary re-renders or layout shifts when adapting to different screen sizes.

# High-level Task Breakdown

1. **Audit All Pages and Components for Responsiveness**
   - Success Criteria: List of all pages/components with notes on current responsiveness issues.

2. **Define Breakpoints and Responsive Design Guidelines**
   - Success Criteria: Documented breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop) and design rules (e.g., padding, font scaling, flex/grid usage).

3. **Update Layouts and Containers**
   - Success Criteria: All main page layouts adapt cleanly to breakpoints (no horizontal scroll, content fits, navigation accessible).

4. **Update Individual Components for Responsiveness**
   - Success Criteria: All UI components (cards, forms, buttons, modals, etc.) scale and reflow appropriately at each breakpoint.

5. **Test and Refine with Real and Simulated Devices**
   - Success Criteria: Manual and automated tests confirm correct appearance and usability on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

6. **Document Responsive Patterns and Lessons Learned**
   - Success Criteria: Section in project docs or scratchpad summarizing responsive strategies and any reusable code/patterns.

## Responsiveness Audit Notes

- **Pages:** All main pages (Index, About, Contact, Shop, NotFound) need to be checked for layout, spacing, and content scaling at mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.
- **Home Components:** These are likely used on the landing page and must be checked for stacking, image scaling, and text wrapping.
- **Layout Components:** Header and Footer must be responsive for navigation and accessibility.
- **UI Components:** ProductCard, carousel, navigation-menu, sidebar, and table are high-priority for responsive behavior. Other UI elements (buttons, forms, dialogs, etc.) should be checked for minimum tap targets and overflow issues.

**Next Step:**  
Proceed to define breakpoints and responsive design guidelines, then begin updating layouts and containers.

## Responsive Design Guidelines

### Breakpoints (Tailwind CSS defaults)
- **Mobile:** `sm` — 640px and up
- **Tablet:** `md` — 768px and up
- **Small Desktop:** `lg` — 1024px and up
- **Large Desktop:** `xl` — 1280px and up
- **Extra Large:** `2xl` — 1536px and up

### General Guidelines
- Use Tailwind's responsive utilities: `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`, `2xl:`
- Use `flex` and `grid` layouts for adaptive structure.
- Ensure images and media use `max-w-full` and `h-auto`.
- Use `container mx-auto px-4` for page wrappers.
- Navigation should collapse into a hamburger menu or drawer on mobile/tablet.
- Avoid fixed widths; use `w-full`, `min-w-0`, and responsive sizing.
- Text should scale and wrap appropriately; use `text-base`, `text-lg`, etc., with responsive variants.
- Ensure tap targets (buttons, links) are at least 44x44px on mobile.
- Hide or collapse non-essential content on smaller screens using `hidden`, `block`, `md:hidden`, etc.
- Test all interactive elements for accessibility and usability at all breakpoints.

# Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- Breakpoints and design guidelines defined using Tailwind CSS defaults and best practices.
- Ready to proceed to updating layouts and containers for responsiveness.

# Lessons

- Tailwind's default breakpoints are generally sufficient for most projects, but can be customized in `tailwind.config.js` if needed.
